    <h1>Hobbies and Interests</h1>
    <p>
        I'm especially interested in getting to root-causes of things, First Principles, etc.
        But I also have a wide range of hobbies and interests that I enjoy in my free time.
        Here are a few of my favorites:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Spending time with my wife and two boys</li>
        <li>Traveling to new places</li>
        <li>Creating new ideas and projects</li>
        <li>Reading books on various topics, especially history and technology</li>
        <li>Staying active through weightlifting and jogging</li>
        <li>Playing guitar</li>
        <li>Cooking and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These are the things that keep me motivated and inspired in both my personal and professional life.
